SOFTMAX
---
will return a value within the range of (0-1) that can be represented as a probability of an outcome from a model.
This is extremely useful in image classification where outputs may not be as clear. The output of 0 would mean that there
is very little confidence in that answer while 1 would be it would be certain of that output. Additionally, if you want to convert
the set of values back to an integer to find which entry had the highest probability just use the argmax() function.

    - useful in multiclass-classification models
        - ie. image classification
        - text classification etc.
